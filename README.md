# Final Project "Learning Basic Web Programming" Dicoding
## Submission: Final Project on Creating a Website
### Description:
#### criteria in the web programming application that I made as follows:
- HTML structure:
    - There are <html>, <head>, and <body> tags that make up the basic structure of a web page.
    - Defined character set and viewport for responsiveness.
    - Uses the <title> tag for the page title.
    - There are links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
- Navbar:
    - The navbar consists of several menu items designed horizontally.
    - It uses <nav> tags to mark navigation.
    - It uses the <a> tag to link to sections within the page using the ID as a reference.
- Main Content:
    - Uses the <main> tag to mark the main content.
    - The main content is divided into several sections using <article> tags for each section such as About, Education, Experience, Certificates, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
    - Each section has a unique ID to be referenced in the navbar.
- Sidebar:
    - Uses the <aside> tag to display side content.
    - In this case, the aside is used to display the profile photo.
- Footer:
    - Uses the <footer> tag to mark the bottom of the page.
    - Displays copyright information.
- JavaScript:
    - There is a JavaScript script that handles scrolling to a specific section when a link in the navbar is clicked.
    - Adds a visual effect in the form of a yellow border (focus) on the section that is being displayed after the link in the navbar is clicked.
- CSS Styling:
    - Provides styling for HTML elements.
    - Gives a hover effect to the navbar.
    - Provides a focus effect on the content section when the link in the navbar is clicked.
    - Using media queries for responsiveness, for example for different layouts on different devices.
